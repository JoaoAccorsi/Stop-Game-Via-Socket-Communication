# Stop-Game-Via-Socket-Communication

Implementation of Stop Game using one server and two clients in python.

The communication between the server and the clients is done via sockets.

## How to run

Run the server first:
python server.py

Then run the clients (as much as you want):
python client.py

## What is killer.py?

This is a script that is going to close the local server. It is used for testing purposes, when the server is busy and you want to close it.
